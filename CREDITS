CREDITS FOR WWW::Yahoo::Groups 1.8.1

Simon Hanmer for having problems with the module, thus resulting in
improved error reporting, param validation and corrected prerequisites.
Since then, Simon also provided a basis for the lists() and
last_msg_id() methods and is causing me to think harder about my
exceptions.

Aaron Straup Cope (ASCOPE) for writing XML::Filter::YahooGroups
which uses this module for retrieving message bodies to put into RSS.

Randal Schwartz (MERLYN) for pointing out some problems back in 1.4.

Autrijus Tang (AUTRIJUS) for Locale::Maketext::Lexicon and Sean M
Burke for Locale::Maketext. With any luck this module is now
appropriate internationalised, albeit not localised.

Ray Cielencki (SLINKY) for first_msg_id and "Age Restricted" notice
bypassing.
