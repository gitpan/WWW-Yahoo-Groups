CREDITS FOR WWW::Yahoo::Groups 1.91

Simon Hanmer for having problems with the module, thus resulting in
improved error reporting, param validation and corrected prerequisites.
Since then, Simon also provided a basis for the lists|/lists and
last_msg_id|/last_msg_id methods and is causing me to think harder about my
exceptions.

Aaron Straup Cope (ASCOPE) for writing XML::Filter::YahooGroups
which uses this module for retrieving message bodies to put into RSS.

Randal Schwartz (MERLYN) for pointing out some problems back in 1.4
and noting problems caused by the hash randomisation.

Ray Cielencki (SLINKY) for first_msg_id and "Age Restricted" notice
bypassing.

Vadim Zeitlin for yahoo2mbox from which I blatantly stole
some features.  (Well, I say _stole_ but yahoo2mbox is
public domain).

Andy Lester (PETDANCE) for writing about this module in _Spidering Hacks_.

iTerrence Brannon (TBONE) for reporting the example program
and empty body bugs.
