CREDITS FOR WWW::Yahoo::Groups 1.7.7

Simon Hanmer for having problems with the module, thus resulting in
improved error reporting, param validation and corrected prerequisites.
Since then, Simon also provided a basis for the lists() and
last_msg_id() methods and is causing me to think harder about my
exceptions.

Aaron Straup Cope for writing XML::Filter::YahooGroups which
uses this module for retrieving message bodies to put into RSS.

Randal "Merlyn" Schwartz for pointing out some problems back in 1.4.

Autrijus Tang for Locale::Maketext::Lexicon and Sean M Burke for
Locale::Maketext. With any luck this module is now appropriate
internationalised, albeit not localised.
