Changes for 1.7.7 (14 Oct 2002)
   - This file mentions the lines at which CPAN/BACKPAN are drawn.
   - Aligned items in Build.PL =)
   - Added Module::Signature test, for those with said module.
   - Made it so Test::Prereq would not barf that Module::Signature is
     not actually required. We just require a particular version of
     Module::Signature if it is actually installed.
   - I18N and L10N!
   - Thus lots of new files and Build.PL extended massively.
   - Remove Test::Prereq since it was having major problems.
   - Added Test::Signature
   - Skip YAML tests if YAML is not installed.
